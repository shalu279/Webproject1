                    <p><b>Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT- Delhi)</b> is a public institute of technology located in Delhi, India.
                         It is one of the 23 Indian Institutes of Technology created to be a Centre of Excellence for India's training, 
                         research and development in science, engineering and technology. IIT Delhi is ranked as one of the most prestigious
                          engineering as well as management/business institutions in India.[5]Established in 1961,
                           it was formally inaugurated in August 1961 by Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research
                            & Cultural Affairs. The first admissions were made in 1961. The current campus has an area of
                             320 acres (or 1.3 km2) and is bound by the Sri Aurobindo Marg on the east, the Jawaharlal
                              Nehru University Complex on the west, the National Council of Educational Research and
                               Training on the south, and the New Ring Road on the north. It is flanked by Qutb Minar and 
                               the Hauz Khas monuments.[4]

The institute was later decreed in the Institutes of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology Amendment Act, 1963, and accorded the status of a full University with powers to decide its academic policy, conduct its examinations, and award its degrees.[6]</p>

                            The concept of IIT was first introduced by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, then a Member of Education on the Viceroy's executive council. Following his 
                            recommendations, the first Indian Institute of Technology was established in the year 1950 in Kharagpur. 
                            In his report, Shri Sircar suggested that such institutes should also be established in different parts of
                            the country. The Government, having accepted these recommendations of the Sircar Committee, decided to establish
                            more Institutes of Technology with the assistance of friendly countries who were prepared to help. The first 
                            offer of help came from the USSR, who agreed to collaborate in the establishment of an Institute through 
                            UNESCO in Bombay. This was followed by the Institutes of Technology at Madras, Kanpur, and Delhi with 
                            collaborations with West Germany, the United States, and UK respectively.[citation needed]
